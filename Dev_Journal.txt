First setup, followed this tutorial:
https://medium.com/@bromix/electron-application-with-vue-js-and-vuetify-f2a1f9c749b8

npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create electron-app
vue add vuetify
vue add electron-builder

Result: Everything for Vue, Electron & Vuetify was working perfectly, but the folder structure was not correct to scale as an enterprise application.
Default folder structure:
ProjectName
 - src
 --- main.js

This is what the folder structure should be:
ProjectName
 - src
 --- Application
 ------ ProjectName
 --------- main.js

This way we can have a framework folder and everything will be contained within the src project root folder.

All files in the src path were moved into the new folder structure path: @/src/Application/ProjectName/.

Result: Build is completely broken.

Found this blog article:
https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2019/03/18/vue-cli-3-rename-src-folder/
And this article:
https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2019/03/11/vue-cli-3-full-stack/
And this GitHub bug report:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/1134

After implementing these fixes, the build is still broken, additional searching and I found this:
https://nklayman.github.io/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder/guide/configuration.html#webpack-configuration

After implementing this fix and a few other obvious changes to various paths in the code files and package.json main entry-point,
the build is now working, but the application gives an error on load and the Vue fails to render.

Error message:
[HMR] Waiting for update signal from WDS...

Looking up the utils.js?e375:21 at the following path:
C:\electronVueJS-App\node_modules\electron-devtools-installer\dist\utils.js

The code for the failure is:

"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
exports.changePermissions = exports.downloadFile = exports.getPath = void 0;

var _electron = require("electron");

var _fs = _interopRequireDefault(require("fs"));

var _path = _interopRequireDefault(require("path"));

var _https = _interopRequireDefault(require("https"));

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { "default": obj }; }

var getPath = function getPath() {
  var savePath = _electron.app.getPath('userData'); // <-------------------- HERE

// Attempted to modify the above code like so, to be able to see what exactly is failing:

var getPath = function getPath() {
	console.log('_electron is: ' + JSON.stringify(_electron));
	console.log('_electron is: ', _electron);
	var savePath = _electron.app.getPath('userData'); // <-------------------- HERE

// Now the build fails to finish the build process, so attempting something else:
rather than:

var _electron = require("electron");

I'm going to do this:
const remote = require('electron').remote;
const app = remote.app;
console.log(app.getPath('userData'));

Then I will attempt:
const remote = require('electron').remote;
console.log('remote electron is: ", remote);
const app = remote.app;
console.log('remote app is: ', app);
console.log(app.getPath('userData'));

and finally:
var getPath = function getPath() {
  var savePath = app.getPath('userData');

Another build-time error:

[OK]

That error is now happening on this line:
const electApp = remote.app;

So clearly that didn't work.

Reverting the code just to be safe, since that was the closest to getting a running application.

Error is now:

utils.js?e375:19 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getPath' of undefined

Attempted to enable Chrome logging via the Electron logging argument:
"electron:serve": "vue-cli-service electron:serve --enable-logging",

This poped some additional windows but no additional information was displayed.

Further investigation with Sean Alexander Free on the VueJS Developers Facebook page discovered the following:
Interestingly, the problem is in the electron-dev-tools-installer node module's index.js on line 18:
var _utils = require("./utils");

The relative path isn't being found because the current directory is electron's renderer path.

Adding console.log(__dirname) after the require shows:
D:\workspace\electronVueJS-App\node_modules\electron\dist\resources\electron.asar\renderer

Which of course is not the correct path to pull in a resource from a node_modules folder via a relative path.

Seems like this is an issue with the installer module itself, but I would assume some webpack trickery could get around this.

My response <Seth Hollingsead>
Ahhh I see what you are saying. So it seems somewhere in the Electron-dev-tools-installer internal code,
a developer reused the init-main path as the same path to base where to go and get the resources to load....
pretty typical programming technique to use since it seems they never planned to allow the system folder structure to
scale for custom enterprise solutions. (E.G. Client-Server).
Further I would make a bet that this wouldn't be the last of the problems I would run into....
and it certainly hasn't been the first.
I will revert back to the default installation and investigate ways to turn the background.js & main.js files
into a wrapper/call-forwarder and try to make it work that way.

Finally got a working folder architecture that I can move forward with. It's not ideal but given everything I've been through above,
it will have to do for now. So now I'm going to finally start moving some of the package.json scripts around and setting up the CICD life-cycle:
Development,
Build,
Deployment,
Release,
Publish,
Lint,
Documentation,
Test,
Versioning,

Here are some of the scripts that came with the system when I executed the startup commands as detailed at the very beginning of this DEV Journal:
"serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
"build": "vue-cli-service build",
"test:unit": "vue-cli-service test:unit",
"test:e2e": "vue-cli-service test:e2e",
"lint": "vue-cli-service lint",
"postinstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps",
"postuninstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps"

Adding the code to application.js gives an error:

var path = require('path');
global.appRoot = path.resolve(__dirname);
var baseFileName = path.basename(module.filename, path.extname(module.filename));

Solved my problem with this:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/3804

For those having this problem, I managed to solve it!

It depends how did you installed @vue/cli. If you did it through:

npm install -g @vue/cli

then you'll have to uninstall it through:

npm uninstall -g @vue/cli

That -g is very important, otherwise you'll still have the global files saved and it would conflict.
After you perform the uninstall, you can simply reinstall it as npm install -g @vue/cli@3.5.0 and it would install the 3.5.0 version. Change the 3.5.0 so something else if you wanna get another version.
